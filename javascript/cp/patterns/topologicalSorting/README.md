# Topological Sorting

## üß† What is Topological Sort?

**Topological Sort** is a linear ordering of vertices in a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** such that for every directed edge `u ‚Üí v`, vertex `u` comes **before** vertex `v` in the ordering.

### Key Points:

-   Only works on **DAGs** (Directed Acyclic Graphs)
-   Often used in:
    -   **Dependency resolution**
    -   **Task scheduling**
    -   **Build systems**
    -   **Course prerequisite planning**

## üîß Techniques

There are two standard ways to perform Topological Sorting:

### 1. **DFS-based (Depth-First Search)**

-   Perform DFS and push nodes onto a stack **after visiting all their neighbors**
-   Final ordering is the **reverse of the finished stack**

### 2. **BFS-based (Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm)**

-   Count **in-degrees** of each node
-   Repeatedly add nodes with `in-degree = 0` to the result
-   Reduce in-degrees of neighbors

## üß™ Time & Space Complexity

| Method       | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| DFS          | O(V + E)        | O(V)             |
| Kahn‚Äôs (BFS) | O(V + E)        | O(V + E)         |

Where:

-   `V` = number of vertices
-   `E` = number of edges

## ‚úÖ Conditions to Apply Topological Sort

-   The graph must be **directed**
-   The graph must be **acyclic**
-   If a cycle is detected, topological sort is **not possible**

# Frequency Counter Pattern

Frequency patterns are a common technique in data structure and problem-solving, especially when working with arrays, strings, or other collections. The idea is to use a frequency map (usually implemented with a hash table, dictionary, or object) to count occurrences of elements and then use this information to solve the problem.

### Key Concepts of Frequency Pattern

Frequency Map: A frequency map stores the number of times each element appears in a collection.
JavaScript: Using a plain object or Map.
Use Cases:

1. Finding duplicates.
2. Determining the most/least frequent element.
3. Anagram detection.
4. Sliding window problems (used with two-pointer techniques).
5. Comparing data structures (like comparing character counts).

### Steps to Apply:

1. Traverse the collection and populate a frequency map.
2. Use the frequency map to answer the problem (e.g., check conditions, find patterns, or optimize search).

# Divide and Conquer

## üß† What is Divide and Conquer?

**Divide and Conquer** is a powerful algorithmic pattern that works by recursively breaking a problem into **smaller subproblems**, solving each independently, and then **combining** their results to form the final solution.

This approach is especially effective when:

-   The problem can be split into subproblems of the same type.
-   Subproblems can be solved independently.
-   Subproblem results can be combined efficiently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Three Main Steps

1. **Divide**: Split the problem into two or more smaller subproblems.
2. **Conquer**: Solve each subproblem recursively.
3. **Combine**: Merge the solutions from subproblems to solve the original problem.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity Pattern

Many Divide and Conquer problems follow a recurrence relation like:  
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)  
which solves to:  
T(n) = O(n log n)

## ‚úÖ When to Use

Use **Divide and Conquer** when:

-   The problem is recursive in nature.
-   It can be broken into **smaller independent subproblems**.
-   You can **combine** the solutions from subproblems efficiently.

# Single Number

### 📝 Problem Description

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, where **every element appears exactly twice** except for **one element** which appears only once,  
return the element that appears only once.

You must implement a solution with **linear runtime complexity** and use **only constant extra space**.

### 📥 Input

-   `nums`: number[]  
    An array of integers where:
    -   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10⁴`
    -   `-3 * 10⁴ <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10⁴`
    -   Every element appears **twice**, except one.

---

### 📤 Output

-   Return the single number that appears only once.

# Bit Manipulation Problems

## Introduction

Bit manipulation is a technique used to perform operations at the bit level. Since all data in computers is ultimately represented in binary (0s and 1s), bit manipulation offers a way to directly control and modify individual bits within an integer. These operations are incredibly fast and efficient, making them ideal for solving certain types of algorithmic problems.

Bitwise operations include:

-   **AND (`&`)**: Turns on a bit only if both bits are 1
-   **OR (`|`)**: Turns on a bit if at least one bit is 1
-   **XOR (`^`)**: Turns on a bit if bits are different
-   **NOT (`~`)**: Flips each bit
-   **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Shifts bits to the left (multiplies by powers of 2)
-   **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Shifts bits to the right (divides by powers of 2)

Common use-cases include:

-   Finding unique elements in arrays
-   Counting set bits (1s)
-   Swapping values without temporary variables
-   Checking if a number is a power of two
-   Bit masking for state representation

This section includes problems that will help you build a strong foundation in using bitwise operations to write efficient code.
